                <h3>Brief History</h3>
                <p>The Dimwood Museum was founded by a group of ferociously loyal fans of Dungeons and Dragons. Their goal has been to create a space where existing fans could experience the game in a special way. It is also designed to welcome those that are new to the game. We are excited to see you!</p>

                <h3>New Exhibits!!!</h3>
                <p>In addition to its regular DnD historical exhibits, The Dimwood is currently featuring two interactive experiences. The first is a virtual reality journey into the Dwarvian era. The second is a costume/photo shop where visitors can choose to dress up in their favorite DnD attire and get their picture taken.  </p>
