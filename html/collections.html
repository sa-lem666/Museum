        <img src="../images/collections/regaliaOfMight.AVIF" style="width:250px;" alt="Regalia of Might" class="artifact-img" />
      
        <div class="field-group">
          <p>Name: Regalia of Might</p>
          <p>Material: A mix of bronze and silver for the staff and crown. The sun-like orb is solid gold.</p>
          <p>Size/Weight/Shape: It's 5 feet tall, shaped like a scepter, and the bronze/gold portions add to its hefty weight of 52.7 pounds.</p>
          <p>Physical Properties: Contains a special top poece that is an orb resembling a sun. This has special significance and means that the holder of the scepter has an illuminated soul that is all-knowing.</p>
          <p>Symbolisms: The crown portion symbolizes a regal position, hence the name "Regalia", and the orb represents the light that can illuminate dark truths.</p>
        </div>
      
        <div class="field-group">
          <p>Estimated Age: The mid 14th century, approximately 1350 AD.</p>
          <p>Preservation State: Due to the nature of its metal materials, the RoM was largely intact. The orb showed signs of partials separation from the staff, however.</p>
          <p>Location Found: Dungeon 27 of the Lesser Tomb Raiders</p>
          <p>Likely Purpose: Provides holder with special, all-knowing powers that can be used for good or evil.</p>
          <p>Comparison: The Regalia can be used in multiple campaigns and settings, which makes its use more flexible in nature.</p>
        </div>
      
        <div class="field-group">
          <p>Evidence of Use: The staff had two crude engravings, believed to be the initials of two of the dragons that had used it.</p>
          <p>Manufacture Clues: The RoM is distinguished by its silver and bronze staff, the bronze crown and the solid gold orb at the top.</p>
          <p>How Found: The RoM can be found in the Arms and Equipment Guide 3.5.</p>
          <p>Burial/Habitat Context: While one would have expected to find the RoM in one of the Royal Halls of Dungeons 8-11, the scepter was placed in Fighter Halls' Dungeon 27, likely to preserve it from the looters of the high-value royal treasure areas.</p>

    <h2>Wand of Orcus</h2>
      <div class="collection-item">
  
        <img src="../images/collections/wandOfOrcus.jpeg" style="width:250px;" alt="" class="artifact-img" />
      
        <div class="field-group">
          <p>Name: Wand of Orcus</p>
          <p>Material: Made of black obsidian and iron; topped with the skull of a human hero killed by Orcus.</p>
          <p>Size/Weight/Shape: The Wand is just under 3 feet in length, and the staff portion resembles the spine of an animal with a short tail. It is light in weight at 2.7 pounds.</p>
          <p>Physical Properties: The Wand is haunting and exudes evil vibes.</p>
          <p>Symbolisms: Its original form depicted the skeletal form of a righteous person killed by Orcus. The final form was less morbid (a solid white gem) and more protective.</p>
        </div>
      
        <div class="field-group">
          <p>Estimated Age: ~1200 years old. Sources report on the Wands powers in stories as early as 827 AD.</p>
          <p>Preservation State: The small white gem that the Wand turned into was only 3 inches in diameter. It was made of shiny white marble that had been coated with special resin to preserve its integrity.</p>
          <p>Location Found: The courtyard of the Palace of Dragonsbane, under a white tree with golden leaves.</p>
          <p>Likely Purpose: The numerous stories about Wand of Orcus report on its magical powers of destruction, initially used for evil. However, they also claimed that it was converted into a small white gem and buried under a tree which prevented demons from entering the Palace.</p>
          <p>Comparison: The Wand of Orcus is special because of its changing purpose over time. It evolved from a tool for evil action into a symbol of protection from evil.</p>
        </div>
      
        <div class="field-group">
          <p>Evidence of Use: The 1976 book, Eldritch Wizardry, was the first to report on the Wand and its powers. It estimated that Orcus used it as far back as 827 AD.</p>
          <p>Manufacture Clues: The small white gem was described as heart-shaped, which made it distinctive.</p>
          <p>How Found: The archeological team mapped the palace courtyard based on the inner walls. Evidence of golden leaves led them to dig deeper to find the reputed white stone/gem.</p>
          <p>Burial/Habitat Context: The Wand (in its final form) was buried 27 inches below where the gold leaves were discovered.</p>

    <h2>Imaskarcana</h2>
      <div class="collection-item">
  
        <img src="../images/collections/imaskarcana.AVIF" style="width:250px;" alt="" class="artifact-img" />
      
        <div class="field-group">
          <p>Name: The Third Imaskarcana</p>
          <p>Material: A slate, metal-encased book with the pages that were formerly dragons who used the Imaskarcana incorrectly.</p>
          <p>Size/Weight/Shape: Weighing in at just one pound, shaped like an ancient tome, and measuring 10 inches by 12 inches.</p>
          <p>Physical Properties: The interior of the tome is lined with the hide of a blue dragon. Curiously, the book cannot be read; instead, once a day it will answer questions posed to it in the Roushoum language.</p>
          <p>Symbolisms: The Third Imaskarcana was used to both ward against spells and to employ other powerful spells.</p>
        </div>
      
        <div class="field-group">
          <p>Estimated Age: Approximately 5500 years old.</p>
          <p>Preservation State: The exterior of the item is largely intact, but the inner pages show significant erosion from exposure to the elements. It must be handled with gloved hands in a temperature controlled space.</p>
          <p>Location Found: Gduar's Garden</p>
          <p>Likely Purpose: Holders of this item are enabled with 27 Spell Resistance powers. </p>
          <p>Comparison: This item was less intact than many other artifacts in this collection, which is largely due to its composition materials. </p>
        </div>
      
        <div class="field-group">
          <p>Evidence of Use: The book was reputed to be made of pages of vellum and even the skin of elves and humans. The tome found has pages made of as yet unidentified substances that may be homo sapiens in some form.</p>
          <p>Manufacture Clues: The blue dragon lining was curiously intact, which led to easy identification of the tome.</p>
          <p>How Found: An incidental finding while searching for the Wand of Orcus.</p>
          <p>Burial/Habitat Context: The tome was discovered in a different area of the courtyard of the Palace of Dragonsbane. It is believed that this could also have been part of a garden in a different era.</p>

      <h2>Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</h2>
      <div class="collection-item">
  
        <img src="../images/collections/axeOfTheDwarvishLords.JPG" style="width:250px;" alt="" class="artifact-img" />
      
        <div class="field-group">
          <p>Name: Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</p>
          <p>Material: The axe blade was made from some steel-like metal. The metal handle is short and there is an overal shininess in its appearance.</p>
          <p>Size/Weight/Shape: The Axe is on the small side, more suitable for a person of small stature.</p>
          <p>Physical Properties: It has runes engraved on it and a precious stone was inserted into the shaft.</p>
          <p>Symbolisms: Peace, law and order.</p>
        </div>
      
        <div class="field-group">
          <p>Estimated Age: 14,000 years old, from the 56,000 DR era.</p>
          <p>Preservation State: The runes and stones had fallen out of their placements and repair is needed. However, the structure of the piece is largely intact.</p>
          <p>Location Found: The Axe was lost for many centuries, and was rumored to be lying in the belly of a now-dormant volcano. This is ultimately where it was found.</p>
          <p>Likely Purpose: The original purpose of the Axe was to create order and calm in the Dwarvian world. It was created with materials from a blazing volcano by their leader. It brought peace and societal norms with it.</p>
          <p>Comparison: Similarly to other artifacts, the Axe has special powers. It protects the holder against poisoning, improves night vision, and enables special skills with regard to masonry and blacksmithing.</p>
        </div>
      
        <div class="field-group">
          <p>Evidence of Use: The Dungeon Master Guide is the universal source for information on the Axe.</p>
          <p>Manufacture Clues: While the Axe would have been largely easy to duplicate, there is a special hook-like feature on the opposite side of the sharp edge that gives it special form. The axe found contains all the features described in dwarvian history.</p>
          <p>How Found: It was finally discovered by researchers after a long search in the 135th search site.</p>
          <p>Burial/Habitat Context: The Axe was found buried in a niche in a volcanic cave near where the historic dwarvian communities resided.</p>

      <h2>Cloak of the Manta Ray</h2>
      <div class="collection-item">
  
        <img src="../images/collections/cloakOfTheMantaRay.jpeg" style="width:250px;" alt="" class="artifact-img" />
      
        <div class="field-group">
          <p>Name: Cloak of the Manta Ray</p>
          <p>Material: The Cloak has the appearance of leather when out of the water, but when the wearer enters water, the Cloak becomes like the skin of a manta ray.</p>
          <p>Size/Weight/Shape: In the shape of the manta ray animal, and weighing 1 pound.</p>
          <p>Physical Properties: A transformative costume, the water-submerged Cloak transforms the wearer into a manta-ray-like creature, able to breathe underwater and to swim quickly. The wearer can also attack with the tail spine.</p>
          <p>Symbolisms: The manta ray is a stealthy and angelic creature, skimming through water smoothly with its ergonomic design. The tail is deceptively dangerous and has a long reach.</p>
        </div>
      
        <div class="field-group">
          <p>Estimated Age: 2700 years old</p>
          <p>Preservation State: Almost fully intact, with just a few small areas needing mending.</p>
          <p>Location Found: On an upper wall inside a cave that was partially submerged in the Sea of Turmoil.</p>
          <p>Likely Purpose: The Manta Ray Cloak allowed the wearer to enter and participate in social groups that would otherwise have been unavailable to them. It provided a way into underwater societies and the ability to elevate their standing.</p>
          <p>Comparison: The Cloak is special because it transforms the wearer, changing their appearance and physical abilities. It also provides powers and tools that enable one to fool others.</p>
        </div>
      
        <div class="field-group">
          <p>Evidence of Use: The Cloak is part of several stories that allude to humanoid beings entering and thriving in the world of water creatures.</p>
          <p>Manufacture Clues: The Cloak’s unique shape makes it easily identifiable. The intact tail made it a clear match.</p>
          <p>How Found: Researchers had long hypothesized that the Cloak would be found in a place near the water, enabling the finder to put it on and enter safely into the underworld. </p>
          <p>Burial/Habitat Context: The Cloak was carefully wrapped and stored in a chest that helped with preservation.</p>

      <h2>Ioun Stones</h2>
      <div class="collection-item">
  
        <img src="../images/collections/iounStones.GIF" style="width:250px;" alt="" class="artifact-img" />
      
        <div class="field-group">
          <p>Name: Ioun Stones</p>
          <p>Material: Ioun stones can be found in different colors, which distinguishes their benefits. They are made of stone and are said to be indestructible until they have warded off 20 spells.</p>
          <p>Size/Weight/Shape: Approximately 4 ounces in weight, rounded, and measuring less than 2 inches in diameter.</p>
          <p>Physical Properties: There are 20 different colors of Ioun stones, each with a different magical power. The holder is told to toss the stone into the air to begin its orbit around their head.</p>
          <p>Symbolisms: Signifying Leadership, the Ioun stones are named after the god of knowledge and prophecy.</p>
        </div>
      
        <div class="field-group">
          <p>Estimated Age: 2727 DR era, 6500 years old</p>
          <p>Preservation State: The stones discovered were in pristine condition. Researchers speculate that there could have been additional stones in the area, but those that had already been used turn to ash gray and vanish among the soil.</p>
          <p>Location Found: The remains of the Lost Laboratory of Kwalish.</p>
          <p>Likely Purpose: The purpose of the stones was to help ward off spells. Depending on the color of the stone orbiting one’s head, the benefit conferred could be agility, awareness, fortitude, mastery, etc.</p>
          <p>Comparison: The stones, like other items, carry magical powers. However, differently to many other artifacts, have a largely temporary effect. For this reason, many were created over time.</p>
        </div>
      
        <div class="field-group">
          <p>Evidence of Use: The Masters Guide references the Kwalish Lab, and mentions the common use of Ioun Stones.</p>
          <p>Manufacture Clues: The stones are described as having very specific colors, so once found, they were quickly identified.</p>
          <p>How Found: Searchers combed through the below-ground areas of the Palace Dragoness, a large archeological dig, which were reputed to be where a production facility had been built.</p>
          <p>Burial/Habitat Context: The Lost Laboratory of Kwalish was similar to a production factory for magical items. The Ioun stones were found in different bags, each holding a selection of stones of a particular color. </p>
